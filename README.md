WWEVoting

Used to place votes on WWE.com. WWE, you should probably fix this, maybe...

Currently setup for the following Poll: http://www.wwe.com/inside/polls/who-would-you-rather-see-seth-rollins-face-inside-hell-in-a-cell

In regards to REDIT http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2ikicb/in_case_youre_wondering_about_the_preliminary/

If you have PHP installed (most macs at least do) just simply clone or copy the script and run:

php WWEVotingFTW.php
